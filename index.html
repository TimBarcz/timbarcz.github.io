            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm an accomplished, energetic, and technically sophisticated ecommerce leader and revenue driver. I'm a detail oriented person with a unique ability to efficiently break down complex technical problems, develop an action-oriented plan, and execute that plan, leading to immediate revenue growth and an improved customer experience. I have a long and successful track record of enhancing team performance productivity, attracting new and repeat business, and driving optimized customer experience.</p>
            <p>
                I believe in the power of technology and what technology can do for a business. The vast majority of businesses. I've encountered can't or don't see the immense opportunities that are available to them. Of those that do see the potential, they don't
                have the skillset or people to enable the change they seek. I have the attitude, knowledge, and skillset to walk into a business and help
                them understand what's truly possible and how to get there. My background in software and more recent experience in eCommerce and marketing
                lead me to be the ideal person in today's rapidly changing environments.</p>
            <p>
                Further, I believe that teams outperform individuals. Relentless curiosity and learning in all aspects of operations. Simplicity over complexity
                in systems and architectures. Quality as a core principle. Agile methodologies bring more success, and details matter, and I sweat the details.
